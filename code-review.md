### Code review

#### Workflow
1. Author create a pull request
2. A member of the team(reviewer) reviews the pull request. The reviews might make comments about issues. The author should fix those issues and recreate or update his pull request
3. The reviewer merges pull request

#### Rules of thumb

1. Follow code conventions
2. Keep pull request skinny.
    If a pull request has lots of logic and it's not possible to split it up, then an author and a reviewer should do code review together.
```
10 lines of code = 10 issues. 500 lines of code = “looks fine.” Code reviews.
