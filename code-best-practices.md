### Uncle Bob's rules:
1. All functions should be 8 or fewer lines.
- No function should have more than two levels of indent.
- Names should be communicative and explicit.
    - Variables in short scopes should have short names
    - Variables in long scopes should have long names
    - Functions in long scopes should have short names
    - Functions in short scopes should have long names
- The code should read like well written prose and have very few comments.
- As you read the code you should not have to look up the definitions of the variables and functions being called. They should be obvious.
- Function calls should have 3 or fewer arguments, with a preference for fewer.
- Unit test coverage should be close to 100%, and the programmer should know the coverage number.
- Unit tests should be short, easy to read, and easy to understand. You should be able to understand the program by reading the tests.
- The tests should execute very quickly. Long running tests are a symptom of carelessness.
